Introduction:-
            Java Programming involves a two step process compilation and execution. Thesse step
            convert source code into bytecode and then into native code for execution on a machine

How code in Running?
    i. compilation:
    - Java compiler translates the source code into bytecode (.class file)
    - Bytecode is platform independent and can run on any machine with JVM installed
    - JVM translates the bytecode into native machine code
    ii. Execution:
    - JVM loads the native code into memory
    - JVM executes the native code
    - JVM provides runtime environment for the program to run
    iii. Garbage Collection:
    - JVM automatically frees the memory occupied by the objects that are no longer in use
    iv. Exception Handling:
    - JVM provides exception handling mechanism to handle runtime errors
